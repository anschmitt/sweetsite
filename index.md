## SWEET: Shallow Water Equation Environment for Tests, Awesome!

Welcome to the website of the SWEET development!


# Features

This library supports various kinds of simulations (not only Shallow Water)
on 2D surfaces. The currently supported surfaces are
  * the 2D torus (bi-periodic plane) and
  * the sphere

For discretization, we use
  * the double FFT for the plane and
  * Finite-differences on the plane
  * Spherical Harmonics on the sphere.
  
# Applications

Test implementations for the following applications are available:
  * Shallow-water equations
  * Advection
  * Burgers'
  
# Repository
