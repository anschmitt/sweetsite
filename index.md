<h1 id="features">Features</h1>

<p>This library supports various kinds of simulations (not only Shallow Water)
on 2D surfaces. The currently supported surfaces are</p>
<ul>
  <li>the 2D torus (bi-periodic plane) and</li>
  <li>the sphere</li>
</ul>

<p>For discretization, we use</p>
<ul>
  <li>the double FFT for the plane and</li>
  <li>Finite-differences on the plane</li>
  <li>Spherical Harmonics on the sphere.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="applications">Applications</h1>

<p>Test implementations for the following applications are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shallow-water equations</li>
  <li>Advection</li>
  <li>Burgersâ€™</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
